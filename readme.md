# Must Know
Has soo **many things** that you must know and no one will teach you how to do. 
__Isn't enough__ know how works something or just a **small piece**, you __must know__ the __whole thing__.

I'm created that repo for **studying** things that you must use all the day but in fact you didn't know how powerfull is.
